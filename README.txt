For my code, I have a class called Waterbottle, that takes in three different variables, color, brand, and water. The purpose of this class is to determine how much water you have drank from the bottle, it will also tell you how much water you are putting into the bottle. For the fill water functions within the class it tells you if the bottle is overfilling. Then with the empty bottle function class it will tell you if the bottle is empty.


Within my class, as said above, there are three data variables that I am taking, the first being color which determines the color of the bottle. The second being brand, determining the brand of the bottle. The last variable is water, this is used to determine the size of the bottle.


Then for my first method I have takes in the self and liquid and is used to determine how much water is being used to fill th bottle, if the liquid is too much for the bottle then it will overflow, if the liquid is not too much then it will print how much water was filled into the bottle. The second method takes in the same two things, however this method is used to get how much water you are drinking from the bottle. It can print if the bottle is empty and it will also print how much water you have drank from the bottle. It also returns how much water was in the bottle to start and then how much water is left in the bottle.


For my democode I decided to have it show the drink_water method first returning how much water was in the bottle, then printing how much water was drank and then returning how much water is left in the bottle. Next you can see that I use my get_color function to get the color of the second waterbottle.Last you can see that I use the get_brand fucntion to get the brand of the water bottle. 


All that needs to be done ot test this code is just run it as is. There is nothing that has to be downloaded or inputted to change the code in any way.
